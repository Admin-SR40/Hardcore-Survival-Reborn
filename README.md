# **Hardcore Survival Reborn**

A Minecraft datapack that makes game much much harder!

## Information
This is the reborn version of the **Hardcore Survival**, the old version is stuck with MC 1.20.4 so updating is basically impossible, and the code is terrible which I can't continue working on it, so **Hardcore Survival Reborn** is here!

Everything is refactored, better performance and game experience is waiting for you, have a try?

## Update info
- Latest version: **1.0 Beta**
- Date: **25/2/1 19:00** (UTC +08:00)

## Requirements
- Minecraft **1.21.4+** is highly recommended!
- No more requirements, that's easy!

## How to use
1. Open your world folder, the path should be `.minecraft/saves/world` or `.world/`.
2. Open the datapacks folder.
3. Drag this datapack into it.
4. Join the game, and run `/datapack enable "file/Hardcore Survival Reborn"`.
5. All done! Good job!

## Good to know
- You can run other datapacks at the same time, but I'm **not** recommend to do so.
- If you accidently broke something, just reload by using `/reload`, it should be fine.
- You **cannot** distribute the datapack without my permission.
- Modify the datapack for yourself is okay, but you **can't** claim that you made the pack.

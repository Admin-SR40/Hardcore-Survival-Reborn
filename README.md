# Hardcore Survival Reborn

A Minecraft datapack that makes game much much harder!

## Information
This is the reborn version of the **Hardcore Survival**, the old version is stuck with MC 1.20.4 so updating is basically impossible, and the code is terrible which I can't continue working on it, so **Hardcore Survival Reborn** is here!

Everything is refactored, better performance and game experience is waiting for you, have a try?

The **mod version** is out! You can download and use it just like other mods!
